**FEEDBACK on IExec Tools**
 
 **Documentation**: The "Zero-to-Hero" tutorials are great, but we need more advanced patterns. Specifically, dealing with **large datasets** (like our bulk rent rolls) and best practices for **data persistence** between tasks.
-   **Performance**: The "Cold Start" time for TEE initialization (sometimes 30s+) is a hurdle for consumer-facing apps. Implementing a "Warm Enclave" feature or optimizing the boot process would significantly improve UX.
-   **Explorer**: The iExec Explorer is functional, but visualizing the *flow* of a deal (Request -> Match -> Computation -> Result) could be more intuitive for new developers debugging their first dApp.
