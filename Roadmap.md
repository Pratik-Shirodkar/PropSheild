## 🚀 Future Roadmap

### 1. Gasless Verification (Account Abstraction)
We have designed the architecture for a fully gasless experience to lower the barrier for non-crypto natives.
*   **Current State**: Landlords require xRLC/ETH to transact.
*   **Target State**: We integrated Account Abstraction (conceptually designed for Safe/Biconomy) to allow a "Paymaster" to sponsor gas fees.
*   **User Flow**: Landlord clicks "Verify" -> Paymaster signs transaction -> Landlord pays $0 gas.
*   **Impact**: seamless onboarding for Web2 Real Estate users.

### 2. Regulatory Compliance Engine (Inspired by "Regulatory Compliance Checker")
Since we are processing data in a TEE, we will add **Automated KYC/AML checks** directly into the scoring pipeline.
*   **Differentiation**: Institutional capital *requires* compliance. Providing a "Compliance Badge" alongside the Credit Score makes PropShield enterprise-ready.

### 3. Private Real Estate Tokenization
Move beyond simple loans to **Tokenized Debt Positions**.
*   **Vision**: Allow lenders to buy fractional ownership of the debt (NFTs), enabling secondary market trading of these privacy-preserved assets.

### 4. Confidential Insurance
Integrate with insurance protocols where the TEE verifies **Property Insurance Coverage** to automatically lower interest rates for insured assets.
